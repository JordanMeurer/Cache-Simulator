# Cache-Simulator
A cache simulator emulates a CPU cache. The program takes a file from a user that is a list of addresses. The user will then input arguments what the cache size, block size, associativity, policy (LRU or FCFS), tracking (print real time of hits and misses of the cache), and the input file. Once the process is complete it will print out the final results cache simulator.
